                <h1>Taxes</h1>
                <br>

                <p>Taxes play a pivotal role in shaping the economic landscape of any country, and Kenya is no
                    exception. As a developing nation with aspirations of achieving sustained economic growth and
                    improved social welfare, understanding the intricate web of taxation is crucial.</p>

                <br>
                <p>From the revenue generated to fund public services and infrastructure development to the
                    redistribution of wealth and
                    promotion of economic stability, taxes are the backbone of a nation's financial ecosystem.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Please keep in mind that tax laws and regulations can change, and specific circumstances can vary, so
                    it's important to refer to the most recent and accurate sources for information regarding taxes and
                    deductions in Kenya. If you're an employee, your employer's payroll department or a tax professional
                    should be able to provide you with precise details about the taxes and deductions that apply to your
                    situation.</p>

                <h2>Types of Taxes</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                1. Income Tax (PAYE - Pay As You Earn): This is a progressive tax on an individual's income,
                deducted at source by the employer. The rate varies depending on income levels.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. National Social Security Fund (NSSF): Both employees and employers contribute a percentage of
                the employee's salary to this retirement savings fund.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF): This provides medical coverage to employees and their
                dependents. Contributions are deducted from an employee's salary.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. The National Housing Development Fund (NHDF): This was first established in 2018 through the
                Finance Act, and managed by the National Housing Corporation (NHC), with an objective of raising
                funds from various sources in an initiative aimed at providing affordable housing to Kenyans
